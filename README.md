## Hi 👋, I am Akshay

Currently, I am working at [Oppia Foundation](https://www.oppia.org/) on the [android repository](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/pulls/anandwana001). 
- Fixing/Writing Unit and UI test cases based on Espresso and Robolectric Frameworks. 
- Set up the Static Analysis on CircleCI/GitHub Actions. 
- Working closely with the design team to ensure support on various screen sizes. 
- Involved with the organization's Onboarding Team, helping new contributors to get started with the open-source contributions by mentoring them in the starting issues and keeping Wiki up to date. 
- Also, manages the Developer Workflow experience for the android team.

I am passionate about the Google Communities and Student Clubs. I was first selected as an Android Facilitator in Applied CS with Android program by Google Developers. Next, I was awarded the status of Developer Student Clubs Lead and recognize the work by taking me to the Google I/O 2018. [Featured my story on Google Developers YouTube channel is a proud moment for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1JuamnN4_Q).
