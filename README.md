## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Akshay

As a budding Android Developer, I am improving skills daily through which I can help in developing good android apps with more focus on <b>Structure Building</b>, <b>User Interface</b> and majorly focusing on <b>Shared Testing</b> these days. 

I am passionate about the Google Communities and Student Clubs. I was first selected as an Android Facilitator in Applied CS with Android program by Google Developers. Next, I was awarded the status of Developer Student Clubs Lead and recognize the work by taking me to the Google I/O 2018. [Featured my story on Google Developers YouTube channel is a proud moment for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1JuamnN4_Q).

If you ask my dream job, I would love to be a part of a global program which helps Environment or Students in many ways. Currently, I am proud to be a part of [Oppia Foundation](https://www.oppia.org/).
